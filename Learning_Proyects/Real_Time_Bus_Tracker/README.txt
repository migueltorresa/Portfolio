#Real-Time Bus tracker

This repository contains the necessary files to run a map that shows the tracker of the bus stops between MIT and Harvard.
This file is used by the button on the left top corner on the website with the title, it uses the mapbox framework and the three programming languages: JavaScript, CSS and HTML.
The improvements that can be made are the color of the map, and the accesability of the markers to show which coordenates are on each stop.
